# Enhanced Duplicate Data Validation

## New Features Added

### 1. Pre-signup Validation
- ✅ **Email Check**: Verifies if email already exists before attempting signup
- ✅ **Student ID Check**: Verifies if student ID already exists before attempting signup  
- ✅ **Admin Request Check**: Verifies if admin request is already pending
- ✅ **Cross-table Email Check**: Checks emails across users, admins, admin_requests, and super_admins tables

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages

#### For Students:
- **Email already exists**: "This email address is already registered. Please use a different email or try logging in instead."
- **Student ID already exists**: "This Student ID is already registered. Please use a different Student ID or contact support if this is your ID."
- **Duplicate information**: "This information is already registered. Please check your Student ID and email address."

#### For Admins:
- **Email in users table**: "This email address is already registered. Please use a different email or try logging in instead."
- **Pending admin request**: "An admin request with this email address is already pending approval. Please wait for approval or contact support."
- **Already approved admin**: "This email address is already registered as an admin. Please try logging in instead."

#### General Errors:
- **Network issues**: "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again."
- **Rate limiting**: "Too many signup attempts. Please wait a few minutes before trying again."

- **Missing fields**: "Please fill in all required fields and try again."
- **Database permission**: "Database permission error. Please contact support or try again later."

### 3. Validation Flow

#### Student Signup:
1. Pre-check email in users table
2. Pre-check student ID in users table
3. If either exists, show specific error message
4. If both are unique, proceed with Supabase auth signup
5. If auth succeeds, create user profile
6. If profile creation fails due to duplicate, show specific error

#### Admin Signup:
1. Pre-check email in users table
2. Pre-check email in admin_requests table
3. Pre-check email in admins table
4. If any exists, show specific error message
5. If email is unique across all tables, proceed with signup
6. Create admin request for approval

### 4. Database Queries for Checking Duplicates

Run these queries in Supabase to check for existing duplicates:

```sql
-- Check duplicate emails in users table
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.users 
GROUP BY email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check duplicate student IDs
SELECT student_id, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.users 
WHERE student_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY student_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check emails across all tables
SELECT 'users' as table_name, email FROM public.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'admin_requests' as table_name, email FROM public.admin_requests
UNION ALL
SELECT 'admins' as table_name, email FROM public.admins
UNION ALL
SELECT 'super_admins' as table_name, email FROM public.super_admins
ORDER BY email;
```

### 5. Files Modified
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Added pre-validation and enhanced error handling
- `fix_user_insert_policy.sql` - Added duplicate checking queries

### 6. Testing Scenarios

Test these scenarios to verify the validation works:

1. **Existing Email (Student)**: Try to signup with an email that's already in users table
2. **Existing Student ID**: Try to signup with a student ID that's already registered
3. **Existing Email (Admin)**: Try admin signup with email in users/admins/admin_requests
4. **Duplicate Auth Email**: Try signup with email already registered in Supabase Auth
5. **Network Error**: Test with poor internet connection
6. **Weak Password**: Try with password less than 6 characters

All scenarios should now show appropriate, user-friendly error messages.
